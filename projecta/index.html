          <h3 class="green">Family:</h3>
          <p>
            Nova forms independently, and only one can exist in a single space
            at any time. Objects absorbed by Nova and later released as stars
            can potentially transform into a new Nova, but only if left
            undisturbed for 150 years. Because of this specific and lengthy
            reproduction process, sightings of Nova are extremely rare.

          <h3 class="green">Habitat:</h3>
          <p>
            Nova creatures spawn in empty spaces, such as blank rooms or
            vacuums, though their appearance is never guaranteed. This emptiness
            is essential for Nova’s manifestation, as their nature depends on
            absorbing objects and re-creating them as stars, essentially forming
            their own galaxy. Without this blank canvas, Nova cannot fulfill its
            purpose of cosmic creation.
          </p>

          <h3 class="green">Appearance:</h3>
          <p>
            Nova appears as abnormal, pulsing rings of black circles, moving
            erratically as if lost and searching for something. Once it evolves
            by absorbing objects, it spreads its influence by darkening the
            space it occupies and filling it with newly produced stars. During
            this "star production stage," Nova expands, filling the space with
            its body, mimicking the orbit of a galaxy, like its own version of
            the Milky Way. When all its stars are eventually destroyed, Nova
            shrinks back to its original size.

            >What we know so far about Novavore Stellaris?</span
          >
          The Novavore Stellaris is highly unstable in its first form, largely
          due to the difficulty of meeting and maintaining its specific spawning
          conditions, which are constantly vulnerable to external influences. It
          moves erratically, searching desperately for objects to absorb, driven
          by its desire to create its own family of stars and reproduce. This
          creature is inherently fragile, and the stars it produces from
          absorbed objects are even more delicate—capable of being destroyed by
          the slightest touch or trigger. Novavore Stellaris has a lifespan of
          around 1,000 years, but even reaching this age is challenging due to
          the precarious nature of its spawning, reproduction, and incubation
          process. As a result, these creatures are exceedingly rare, and their
          population is steadily declining. Their frantic movements reflect this
          struggle for survival, making each remaining Nova a desperate,
          endangered presence in the cosmos.

            >Guidelines for human interaction with this creature</span
          >
          Click on the empty spaces around Nova to provide it with objects. Once
          Nova evolves into its second phase, press the "S" key to make it expel
          the newly created stars. Clicking on the stars will cause them to
          instantly die in a burst of circles.
